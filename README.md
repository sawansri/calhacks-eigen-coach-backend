AI powered tutor for exam prep, backstory is that in Brazilian public schools, students don't have the resources to hire private tutors and the exams are too obscure to be featured on websites like KhanAcademy. Our app essentially provides this platform, all users have to do is upload papers and our agents will create a time-aware study guide, with a question bank, flexible question generating, and memory to store progress by topic

## Time-awareness --> study timeline

## Question Bank --> tags and topics

### VectorDB (ChromaDB)

#### Pre-processing before vectorizing in DB
Need LLM to process exams, extracting exam type, labelling each question by topic (tagging them basically)

## Flexible --> no pre-designing, generate on the go

## Memory --> progress tracking by topic
