    "question_prompt": "Explain the primary role of the enzyme Rubisco in the Calvin cycle.",
    "answer": "Rubisco (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) catalyzes the fixation of carbon dioxide to Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), initiating the Calvin cycle.",
    "explanation": "This step, known as **carbon fixation**, is the key entry point of atmospheric carbon into the biological system. The resulting unstable 6-carbon compound immediately splits into two 3-carbon molecules (3-phosphoglycerate).",

    "question_prompt": "Describe the difference between positive and negative feedback loops in biological systems, and provide one example of a negative feedback loop.",
    "answer": "Positive feedback amplifies a stimulus or moves a system further from a set point, while negative feedback counteracts a change to return the system to a set point (maintaining **homeostasis**). An example of a negative feedback loop is the regulation of blood glucose by insulin and glucagon.",
    "explanation": "Negative feedback is far more common in regulatory biology. Another common example is the control of body temperature; if it drops, mechanisms (like shivering) are triggered to raise it back up.",

    "question_prompt": "Define the term 'hybridization' in the context of covalent bonding, and state the hybridization of the carbon atom in a methane (CH4) molecule.",
    "answer": "**Hybridization** is the concept of mixing atomic orbitals (like s and p) to form new, equivalent hybrid orbitals suitable for the pairing of electrons to form chemical bonds. The carbon atom in CH4 is **sp3** hybridized.",
    "explanation": "sp3 hybridization involves one s and three p orbitals combining to form four identical sp3 hybrid orbitals, which point towards the corners of a tetrahedron, explaining methane's geometry.",

    "question_prompt": "Calculate the pH of a 0.010 M solution of HCl.",
    "answer": "The pH is 2.0.",
    "explanation": "HCl is a strong acid, meaning it com  letely dissociates in water, so the concentration of hydrogen ions ([H+]) equals the concentration of HCl, which is 0.010 M. The pH is then calculated as pH = -log10[H+] = -log10(0.010), which equals 2.0.",

    "question_prompt": "State the First Law of Thermodynamics and explain what it implies about energy in a closed system.",
    "answer": "The First Law of Thermodynamics is the law of **conservation of energy**, stating that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or changed in form. It implies that the change in a closed system's internal energy (Delta U) equals the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W). This is often written as the equation: Delta U = Q - W.",
    "explanation": "This law is often called the *work-heat* principle. For an isolated system (no heat or work exchange), the change in internal energy (Delta U) must be zero.",
